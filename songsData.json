        Time pass away
        And I just can't get you off my mind
        Nobody knows
        I hide it inside
        I keep on searching, but I can't find
        The courage to show to letting you know
        I've never felt so much love before
        And once again I'm thinking about
        Taking the easy way out
        But if I let you go, I will never know
        What my life would be holding you close to me
        Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
        (Oh yeah) how will I know if I let you go?
        Night after night I hear my self say
        Why can't this feeling just fade away?
        There's no one like you, you speak to my heart
        It's such a shame we're worlds apart
        I'm too shy to ask, I'm to proud to lose
        But sooner or later I've got to choose
        And once again I'm thinking about
        Taking the easy way out
        But if I let you go I will never know…`,

        Of lovers sleeping tight
        Are rolling by like thunder now
        As I look in your eyes
        I hold on to your body
        And feel each move you make
        Your voice is warm and tender
        A love that I could not forsake
        'Cause I'm your lady
        And you are my man
        Whenever you reach for me
        I'll do all that I can
        Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
        When the world outside's too much to take
        That all ends when I'm with you
        Even though there may be times
        It seems I'm far away
        Never wonder where I am
        'Cause I am always by your side
        'Cause I'm your lady
        And you are my man
        Whenever you reach for me
        I'll do all that I can
        We're heading for something
        Somewhere I've never been
        Sometimes I am frightened
        But I'm ready to learn
        Of the power of love
        The sound of your heart…`,

        In this old empty house
        It's hard to learn what you don't think you need
        You can't live without
        Never leave the sound of the telephone
        But ever since you left
        I've been gone
        Gone crazy, goin' out of my mind
        I've asked myself the reason,
        At least a thousand times
        Goin' up and down this hallway
        Tryin' to leave the pain behind
        Ever since you left,
        I've been gone
        I never saw your face this many times
        When you were really here
        The things you said I never understood
        Are now crystal clear
        I never spent this much time at home
