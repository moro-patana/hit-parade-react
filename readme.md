# Hit Parade in React
## Steps
 ### Tools
  1. These are the following steps to follow:
    
         1.1. git init to install package.json.

         1.2. install react and react-dom 

         1.3. install react-router-dom.

2. Put all the states in the useContext file so that we can reuse them wherever we need them.

3. Create Components folder to store all the components files.

4. Do not forget to link index.css file to the html.

**NB**:
It was very nice project and it was a summary of what we have done during a week. It is helpful to have small project like that after theories.
