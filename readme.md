# Hit Parade in React
## Steps
 ### Tools
  1. These are the following steps to follow:
    
         1.1. git init to install package.json.

         1.2. install react and react-dom 

         1.3. install react-router-dom.

2. Put all the states in the useContext file so that we can reuse them wherever we need them.

3. Create Components folder to store all the components files.

4. Do not forget to link index.css file to the html.

5. Create json file and put the array object of the song list inside.

6. Create a variable and set the array from json as default value.

7. map through that to get the list.

8. To get the styles, filter the song styles and create an html by maping the filter styles.

9. In the form input, change the value of the price name into a number
(i.e: price: (Number(e.target.price.value))) so that you will not get a string.

**NB**:
It was very nice project and it was a summary of what we have done during a week. It is helpful to have small project like that after theories.

Thank you very muchðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
